So this is Julian's Story

When Julian is little he is a little traveler with his flying carpet
One day He met a flying elf with beautiful wings
And he asked where did you get your beautiful wings
The eld says go west and meet the three eye giant
He will tells you where to find your wings
Julian is excited to get his own wings
So he follows what elf says and go west to find the three eye giant
What's gonna happen next?
